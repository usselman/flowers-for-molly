When I was teaching her to ski she would get nervous at the top of the lift and I would say "hold hands, ski tips up" she'd smile and off we'd go.

On her wedding day we were standing outside the church waiting to walk down the isle, she said she was nervous , I said " hold hands, ski tips up" she smiled, and off we went.

I always loved that my children called me "Pop". But on those sleepy mornings on LBI when I had my Molly's coffee waiting for her she would say "Thank you Father"

God I miss that

Dear Molly,

I’m sorry I got to know you more in this past year than the years prior

I’ve learned a lot about you by spending time with your kids

I’ve marveled at Theo’s curiosity and wonder and Georgie’s whimsy and sweet mischief

They’ve shown me how kind and honest and funny you were

You must’ve been resilient too

They certainly didn’t get that from Michael

The guy’s a hot fucking mess

But don’t worry, he’s getting better

We’ve got his back

Wishing you Peace, Jed

### Lindsay Brooke Weiss

I just went back and looked at my last text with Molly. It was today but last year. I told her how much I loved her and how she’s the only connection to my childhood and the only friend I stay in touch with from when we were kids. She told me she loved our “2.0 friendship” bc we really rekindled it around the time she married Michael. I love she and miss her every single day and often go to text her funny anecdotes like I used to do every week.

Many cousins are at Aunt Mary White’s summer home for our yearly summer visit. All trying to find a place to sleep, Paula and I are on the couch’s In the living room when we are told we have to move. Mary Dowd says come over to my house. We go to Mary’s house and we are going to sleep in the bunkbeds in Molly’s room. As we are settled in our bunkbeds, Molly, who is very young, knocks on the door, comes in, and without saying a word, gets her little chair, sits down, and reads us a bedtime story. This had to be around 12 Midnight, & Molly is not going to let us go to sleep without a bedtime story.

### Andrea Blanton

When I think of Molly, I think of someone who was genuinely interested in you, what was going on in your life, always ready to listen. I also loved hearing her stories and sharing of drama/gossip. She was always ready to laugh, have fun, and I’ll always remember her as our own “cheerleader” or hype person when we hosted anything. I can still hear her voice saying “guys, you’re doing great…excellent work..”

### Jamie Walter

It's difficult to choose just 1 Molly story to share. For the past 6 years, Molly would call me to share a memory of her uncle and to remind me that he continued to be remembered with love.

I have decided to choose a story from her younger years. While on an LBI beach she would entertain us with her Olympic gymnastic prowess by performing on a bench & then dismounting in a "spectacular" fashion onto the sand. She emphatically informed us that she Would make it to the Olympics. Georgie, now a gymnast, perhaps, will carry the torch. I love you, my sweet Molly.

The last time I saw you. We were in DC with Kate and Dana, celebrating our years of friendship, our children and our deep love for each other. I can still feel us squeezing each other at dinner. I can still hear your laugh. 

When we were in Miami for Cole’s birthday and you and Trina gave me advice that changed my life. You were always the best giver of wisdom.

When the twins were born and in NicU you were the first person to visit them. You made me feel so comforted and loved.

When You, Trina, Mel and I went to Lake George and had the spookiest fun adventure together.

### Alison Hill

Molly was full of life and personality and a laugh that could not be replicated. The laugh - it’s part half lung, part Jersey, part joy.She seemed to have more hours in the day than everyone else. I’ve never seen someone more on the go, yet super connected to her family, but also always was available to get together with friends. One of our clients, who claimed to have done so in a fit of exhaustion, typed her name as Dolly Mowd once. So Dolly became her name there for a few years.Last but not least, no one had FOMO more than Molly.

I LOVE YOU, DOLLY!

### Cathy Dowd

Hi everyone, I remember when Molly came to help me when Thomas was born. No matter what I asked, she was always ready, willing and able. Laundry, lunch for the big boys, holding and trying to soothe a colicky newborn, poopy diapers (I did saw her gag, but she did not back down), groceries, anything I needed. The other boys were 5, 7 and 8 and wanted to go to Block Island, where we spent our summers, and I did not want to disappoint them. I couldn't manage on my own, Thomas was 2 weeks old, but with Molly's help we arrived on the island. I dont think I thought to warn her that our island life was very quiet. Unpacking and getting our feet in the water that first day was great, but once the kids were in bed I was exhausted. Poor Molly, 20-something and always connected, completely plugged in to everything current, was hit with the reality of what she had agreed to. Once the sun set, there was complete darkness outside, no real neighbors, no street lights, no traffic in our area. She said, "Dont worry about me, go ahead and go to sleep! I'll just watch TV." I had to break it to her, we did not have a TV. "What?!? How do you survive???" she said. This was the summer of 2003, and our trip coincided the big black-out in NYC, which I think helped. The whole of NYC was unplugged (if only for a day or two) and I think she felt the solidarity. While the experience was disorienting and a bit scary (screaming newborn + wild boys = crying mother), she was the most amazing of troopers and the biggest godsend imaginable. She was 100% willing to do all, including strapping all the kids in to their carseats, me in the back nursing the baby, to take the garbage to the dump, which was a stinky place with some rough characters. She took care of business and jumped back in the car, backing right in to someone's pickup in the process, but I did not blame her, I was just filled with love and admiration, watching her get the job done in record time and get us the hell out of there, back to fresh air. She saved my life that summer with her humor and grace and generosity of spirit. As was evident all through her life, Molly was able to jump in to our craziness because of her strong love of family and her willingness to help wherever there was need. I have to go now, I will write more stories later.

### Stefanie Stein

There are friends who come into our lives quietly, and then there are those like Molly—the ones who fill every space with laughter, curiosity, and endless conversations.

We could talk for hours, about everything and nothing, asking all the questions during a story that it would take forever for us to finish. We gossiped hard and loved good gossip!

The world is a little quieter without you Molly, I miss you dearly and think of you all the time. Your voice, our memories will never fade from my heart.

LOVE YOU! XOXOX Stef

### Peter Clutterbuck

Nora, Mike and I were on a ski vacation together in 2024. It was bitterly cold, so we decided to take the day off from skiing, and day drink in Vail. In between the steady stream of Molly’s stories, we would talk about how broke we were, but also strategize our next NYC real estate endeavors. How would we afford such endeavors? A HELOC, of course… Barely able to afford the beers we were drinking, not to mention that vacation, Molly had us in tears chanting “HELOC, HELOC, HELOC!!!” every time the waiter came by for another round. I can still hear voice, and miss her dearly.

### Kate Riesenberg

Molly. the only person i want to tell absolutely everything to. how you had space for so many people, it’s incredible. you were always so generous with your time. so generous to me. so loyal. so forgiving. at times when you did not need to be. i had a dream a few days after you passed— you said to me “i’ve loved you through everything.” and you did. you really did. i’ll be forever grateful for our friendship. i will forever carry you with me.

### Vanessa Rocks

When she would call me “Ness”

The face she would make when you would tell her some really juicy gossip. I can still close my eyes and see it like it was yesterday.

Molly was always one of my biggest supporters on my journey to sobriety. She never gave up on me, she always gave me a safe place to come to.

But she sure loved hearing me tell her some of my tales of woe….”Wait, wait, wait…you smoked crack.”

### Angela Trampota

There are no "favorite" memories of Molly because every memory I have with Molly is a favorite and will be cherished.

I do laugh though, when I think back to when Molly was in grammar school and middle school. Somehow, I become her personal halloween costume designer. She would be so determined to win the school competitions. This was pre- Amazon or online costume shops. I had my Singer sewing machine and Molly and I would collaborate on ideas. Once she was a giant pink ice cream cone. Another year she was a large Mc Donald's French fries. I think the most fitting one was when she was a fully set table with her head sticking through the middle as a flower centerpiece! Molly was the most wonderful and vibrant centerpiece for all of us. Her light remains here through the love she gave us, through Michael, Theo and Georgie. And through all the memories we will continue to share with one another.

With Love, Aunt Ange

### Kelsey Bailey

Molly was one of my favorite people and i know i was one of hundreds who thought the same thing. I think about her often and aspire to mirror the kindness and love she emitted everyday.

Shortly before she passed, i was on a photo set alongside her and we wrapped early so we took a minute to add some makeup touches in the studio vanity, both about to go our separate dinner plans. I remember talking to her about this boy i had just started dating and her of course wanting all the tea, asked me about him and specifically asked how i felt about him and what i liked about him. At the end she asked if he was reliable emphasized how important that trait was in a partner. It was such a small moment and I’m not really sure why it sticks in my mind, but Molly was so undeniably reliable, whether it was with work, friendship or family. And although a small part of her big and wonderful personality, it was a huge part of her i remember and aspire to be in my life. Also spoiler alert, still with that guy and his reliability has helped create a foundation for our relationship that i feel grateful for everyday.

There are so many more small moments that made me look up to Molly. Loved that i got to think of some of this stories today :)

Sending all my love to Michael and the kiddos and thinking of them often.

Molly was my chauffeur to work for a week when I had knee surgery. She drove 2 “ away from the car in front of us at about 80 miles an hour! We laughed and laughed as my nails dug into the seat! Her act of kindness will always be remembered.

### Suzi Jones

I met Molly around 2013-14 when I was working at Gap. Molly was one of the producers at Wieden and Kennedy on the Gap team and she worked under my friend Lora Schulson. All of my friends at W+K told me I would love Molly. The first shoot we did was a big celebrity campaign in Los Angeles including Angelica Houston, Elizabeth Moss, Michael K. Williams, Zosia Mamet, and others. Sally Branka was the makeup artist and I believe this was the first time we both met Molly. I don’t remember much about working with Molly until the second shoot we did for Holiday shot on location in Connecticut. We had a family with 4 kids cast and one of the makeup artists noticed one of the children had chicken pox. I remember someone telling me that Molly had personally driven the family to the local doctor. I thought “that seems like Molly.”

A week or so later a close friend of mine called me to tell me his wife had left him for a woman. I gave him my condolences and he said “you know this woman. She’s on the Gap team at W+K.” And I took a moment to think to myself “who on that team would I leave my husband for?” So I asked him “Is it Molly Dowd?” I told Molly this story years later when I hired her at Warby Parker. I used to like to introduce her as “the only woman I would leave my husband for.” She loved it.

I miss her an think about her every single day.

Beyond being a completely super special, like no equal, all around good vibes and you just have to smile when around her—— Molly really loved a good detective case! We definitely bonded and connected most when we both saw or felt something odd or questionable within a friend group or even among complete strangers and had to get to the bottom of it even if it meant drawing insane conclusions grounded in our our deranged and baseless theories. I miss the  in our texts….She just made me laugh and brought such a funny take on everything. And I just miss her so much…

### Stephanie Bird

Molly was so special to me from the minute I met her (which was in the Cayman Islands!). The first time I realized her funny humor was when we swam with the stingrays and she wouldn't touch them, but was a good sport in the photos! Over the years I loved hearing the funny stories Molly would tell us - the way she dead-panned the stories made them that much funnier. From the one when she gave her mom the middle finger and was caught in the mirror, to the many hilarious stories of the non-Jewish girl begging her way into Jewish sleep away camp. The way she described making her parents buy her a full horseback riding outfit because she was convinced she would become a "horse girl" at camp, and then never even getting on a horse - I have laughed for years about that. Molly truly was a storyteller. She could make a story about getting lost in Italy the funniest thing you ever heard. Aside from making me laugh with my stories, I always felt Molly's innate warmth and genuine care for the people she loved. She kept tabs and kept up with my goings-on, and that made me feel special. Most importantly, Molly gave birth to two of my most favorite people on earth. I see so much of her in both Theo and Georgie, and they are so lucky to have the privilege of being Molly's legacy.

### Ruby Noren

Molly was one of the most incredible people I’ve ever known and I miss her all the time. From the moment we met at Warby Parker, I knew we’d be lifelong friends—it felt like we had known each other forever, we called each other “camp friends.” She was warm, SO funny, loving, smart, and endlessly kind.She was an incredible mom, always talking about Theo and Georgie with so much love and care. I'll never forget laughing at the photo of her post giving birth where she looked like a completely different human. We could talk about anything—family, work, motherhood, or just the latest gossip—and we were always on the same page. She made me belly laugh time and time again.Our last messages were about making dinner plans—I just wish we had made them sooner. To know Molly was to love her, and I still can’t believe she’s gone...but I am so grateful for the time we had.

Molly was one of the kindest, caring and most welcoming person I have ever met. The first time I met Molly, after about 10 minutes I felt like I had known her for years. She had a way of making people feel welcomed and comfortable. She truly was an amazing person. I know that her memory and spirit will live on with her children and Michael.

### Claire Mazur

Molly,

Since you’ve been gone I’ve started using the term “pal” constantly—it is so much better than “bud” or “guy” or “friend” or whatever else I was using before. Plus it makes me think of you.

Chris and I will randomly (but often) bring up the time you put one of Georgie’s poopy wipes back in the empty container and then Michael unwittingly used it to clean his face. The way you would tell the story (and yes I heard you tell it more than once), Michael screamed bloody murder and you immediately started cackling. Thinking about it is an instant, easy belly laugh.

You should know that the person who works at Theo’s school who drove you nuts seems to have improved her attitude (maybe in your honor??) but I still laugh a lot when I think about the text you sent me about her that said “Save your bad personality for your husband like the rest of us.” Isabel wanted to get that printed on a shirt but I told her I wasn’t sure how Michael would feel about it.

I look at our texts all the time. You were a legendary texter, as everybody knows. Once you were texting me from the subway after leaving drop-off and Chris spied you and snuck up behind you and whispered “Tell her I said hi.” I loved that so much because it made the world feel small and sure in a good way. Like we lived in a village.

I want to ask you for advice constantly and I feel a little lost as a parent without you. When Theo and Cam’s teacher quit in the middle of the year I joked (a little bitterly) that you were my husband through it all, because Chris wasn’t as worked up about it and didn’t have the patience for it. But you were always more than willing to hop on the phone at a moment’s notice to air out our shared anxieties and provide up-to-date intel, especially when it came to stuff that concerned our kids. You would take on my queries and conundrums like they were a work assignment and always come back armed with answers sourced far and wide. I was constantly hearing advice passed along from some lady you worked with two jobs ago who has 3 kids in the NYC public school system whose perspective you really trust, and by the way she also gets her done at Jenna Perry, so you know she’s discerning. You are the singular reason Cam goes to the school that he does, and I’m so grateful for that if for no other reason than it gave me an extra year of closeness with you.

As good as your texting skills were, you were also a great phone talker—a rare trait these days. I’ll never forget sitting in the allergist’s office, bored out of my mind waiting for the results of a patch test when you rescued me from my misery by calling to explain that you’d DM’ed someone on Instagram that you sort of knew, who might have some answers we were seeking, but you couldn’t tell if she was annoyed by the question. Classic Molly approach to problem-solving. Or the time I left a parent-teacher conference feeling like I’d gotten barely any information and maybe the teachers hated me. You’d gone in immediately after me, and called as soon as you left to share the boatloads of gossip you’d managed extract in your 20-minute session.

Theo and Georgie are wonderful and bring me so much joy. I find them remarkably likable for children who are not my own. They have your perfect hair and perfect skin and perfect sense of humor. Isabel and I will make sure they have your perfect understanding of the art and currency of gossip, too. Speaking of which: Michael has really stepped up the plate in dealing with all the neurotic gossip-hounds you left behind.

When you died nobody could believe how many friends you had. I think it was less exhausting for you than it is for most people because it was genuine—you didn’t wear yourself out trying to be a version of yourself that you thought people wanted to see, and you liked people most who were authentically themselves. I always felt like I’d known you forever, like we instantly understood each other, and I chalked it up to the fact that we grew up in similar environments not all that far from each other. Then you died and it turned out everybody felt that away about you. Even all your British friends.

I was so proud to know you, so proud to be your one of your many, many friends. I still am.

Love,

Claire

### Nandita Khanna

I have so many memories of Molly that swirl around my head but one picture of her, on July 18, 2018 at a joint bday party I hosted while I was visiting from LA. Theo was due any day, but Molly was there, to celebrate others and do what she did best — be a loving and joyful friend. It meant so much to me to have her there (particularly because that late in pregnancy comfort isn’t the name of the game, and it was a hot NYC summer’s eve), but most of all, this picture of her carrying Theo in her belly is one that I’ll always hold close. <3

I have many beautiful memories of Molly but one of my favorite memories was a day in NYC together.

Mary, Molly, Emily and I had fun strolling the city. We had a wonderful lunch at Sweetie Pie’s ( I believe that was the name) and hung out at Molly’s charming apartment.

It was a very special day for us girls.

Also, I loved Molly’s voice! It was so beautiful, unique and distinct. If I were in another country or somewhere far, far away, without seeing, just hearing her voice, I would know, that’s Molly..that is Molly’s beautiful voice!

### Joe DePaul

Michael is one of my oldest and best friends. We have always told each other everything. I recall going to Brooklyn and him telling me he just started seeing a girl he really liked. So we went to a bar and he introduced me to Molly for the first time. And I said wow what the hell does she see in Mike? As time went on I was fortunate to spend time with Mike and Molly as well as the Dowd’s. Had many random pop up at the family shore home. And just like Mikes family growing up I found my self saying again “ hey Mike can I stay over “ Molly had a very healing presence there was no judgement, you could talk about any subject with her. Even remember playing some kool Kieth for her and her saying “ word turt” it was like she was one of us growing up. She was the perfect person for my best friend and they had the most perfect children together. It is hard for so many she is not with us but she was a gift to us. As I look back on times I spent around her. It gives me a warming feeling like she would just say “ what’s up turt” i can only give back to her my promise to always be there and give the same warm presence she gave me to Mike the kids and all of Mollys family and friends.

I am Molly’s cousin-in-law but she always referred to me as she did her cousins, “hey cuz!”

Our annual Christmas Eve Manhattan toast was a favorite.

We also lit the Chanukah candles together when we were together and it was a Christmas / Chanukah overlap, as she was for sure an honorary Jew.

She loved her family so much which was so beautiful.

We miss her and think of her often.

### Marni Beardsley

hire better than yourself.

a philosophy thats served me well and there was no better example than molly dowd.

she was 1,00O times better in every direction than me and just about everyone around her on our best days - inspiring us all to do and be better.

i met molly because the universe insisted i do so.

there wasn’t a creative director, photographer, producer or cab driver that didn’t fail to mention her to me at one point or another - always with this sort of awe and wonder.

i naturally became a stalker. “um, hello. my name is marni and apparently its imperative i know you”

it didn't take but a minute into our first conversation to be utterly besotted. molly was like no one else i’d ever met - yet felt like i’d known her my entire life. from the jump it was clear what mattered to molly; meaningful connections with people and living a creative, purposeful life.

when talking about our craft, her brilliant visual mind was a faucet for all that inspired her; subtle nuances of emerging photographic trends. the original cut of a silk dress from margiela’s new line. she wondered if i noticed how birds were showing up in every editorial spread at the time—was it just her or was the fashion community becoming one big alfred hitchcock film?

i was struck by her innate ability to transport me in a way that i could envision every last detail, color and clever commentary as if the experience was right in front of me. kinda like how a sports announcer covers the action of a bball game but instead around art, fashion + photography. and never in a braggadocious  way, that was the antithesis of molly.

she simply had a passion for creativity and all that went into it.

by the end of that first call i asked for her hand in marriage. while that didnt happen, i was lucky she agreed to freelance soon after, even luckier when she eventually took a full time role. as long as the agency had a fashion account, molly was all in. her exquisite eye and thirst for beauty including all the insane demands that go into it was a deep gravitational pull she couldn’t not be surrounded by. i marveled how in a cutthroat sea of snobbery and self-importance the fashion world can be, smack dab in the center was genuine, down to earth molly. she was humble to the point of shining the spotlight on others to give credit when she was quietly the creative mastermind. and she could masterfully navigate the most difficult personalities with ease with her impressive high EQ guiding the way.

molly was so fucking funny. she also had one lung. opposing forces working against each other.

i’d answer the phone and her opening salvo was “so, when's the last time you had a celebrity insist their entire entourage come to the shoot and each have their own hair, makeup and private manicurist attend to them individually and expect the client to pay for it? also, the photographer is asking if he really has to be at the pre-pro and demands the crew doesn’t look at him otherwise he won’t be able to create.” we’d erupt into uncontrollable laughter followed by molly howling “my lung! my poor lung!” she didnt need my help in navigating a damn thing. she was a master problem solver who could get on the level of everyone around her, even the most ridiculous bullshit. she just loved to connect and laugh and give her one poor lung a workout.

molly went above and beyond at work - you couldn't help but to take notice. but this was a crater sized distant second to going out of her way for her friends and family. one mere example is when our former colleague was diagnosed with brain cancer followed by the surgery leaving her without much of her memory intact. molly led the charge to help, galvanizing people to come together in meaningful ways. molly would remark how on one hand life could be so beautiful and yet cruel at the same time?

oh the irony. doesn’t god or the universe or whoever the fuck is in charge know molly was the new york sun we were all orbiting around? the ultimate connector of people and selfless force for good.

i can't help but to think she somehow had a hand in producing her beautiful service, a perfect sunny nyc day with every last gorgeous detail considered. including an abundance of birds circling for comedic effect. hundreds upon hundreds of people came together from all over - strangers hugging, laughing and crying with love and aching loss for our girl. the constant theme being how her greatest passion, her one real hobby in life was people. how many felt like they were her closest friend, because she made every last person feel like they were all that mattered. above all, her family, husband and 2 beautiful babies she loved more than my rambling words could ever describe.

hard to believe its been a year since she left this world. grateful having known such an unforgettable soul who made everyone and everything around her more meaningful, colorful and fun.

### Timothy White

I'll never forget my sister and brother in law allowing my and my girlfriend to take their two little children with us for a weekend at the Jersey shore in the middle of the winter. Molly and David were very young...maybe 3 and 4 years old. Yet they trusted me with these two babies even though I was a young wild man without any child experience. They knew how special I thought these kids were and especially my god child, Molly. I loved her so much from the first day we met. She was the cutest, calmest baby with a self assuredness and curisousity that made her personality so peaceful. Now on that weekend, no longer an infant, but a young wide eyed child, I thought she was the absolute cutest and I felt the strongest feeling to protect and love this adorable little girl. Being with the two of them that weekend made me feel something that I've never felt before or since. The responsibility and love for these precious little people made me feel our familial connection, and began a lifelong deep love and respect as they grew into the special adults they became. I'll never forget the feelings from this one weekend that created a bond that lasted throughout our lives.

### Michele August

I met Miss Molly (my nickname for her) when she was working at JWT, Molly was a junior art buyer and I was a photo rep; we worked together creating an estimate for Domino Pizza.

Molly was a treat to work with, I enjoyed working beside her and from there a friendship blossomed . There was 20 year age difference between us, but it did not interfere with our friendship. I felt Molly was an old soul, she fit in and made friends everywhere she went.

I think about Molly every day, I am devastated with her passing.

### Katie Reppert

I only met her once, and so maybe there is no place for this very small memory in your project - but I’m sharing it with you because I know from my own experience that any new little scrap you can get of someone you’ve lost is something worth having.

I met her at a birthday party in Brooklyn one summer night years ago, and I remember how cute her red bandana looked, and wondered if I could pull that off before deciding no, I dont have that long pretty hair. I can’t recall what we talked about or who else was there, but I remember that she instantly felt like an old friend. She drew me in with a warmth and an ease that I will never forget. To be with her was to be instantly comfortable, like I’d known her for years. Her orbit was sunny and bright, and I immediately understood that she was a person who people wanted to be around and spend time with, warm in her sunshine.

I forget people all the time, constantly. But I have a very clear and distinct memory of her, that summer night in Brooklyn, and how she made me - just a stranger - feel. What a rare and special person, what a gift.

Your voice,

Your manners,

The way you called me “cuz”

A beacon of light

Ever aglow with tangible warmth,

Will always be felt

### Ward Williams

One time, Michael and I were making a campaign for GAP. Molly was in charge of the stills set. During callbacks, the three of us sat like American Idol judges seeing model after model. Part of the gig was the models had to move so we asked everyone to dance. We had one guy come in who was the thinnest guy I've ever seen. When he started "dancing," it was a very intense and uncomfortable series of Samurai warrior poses - complete with a lot of uncomfortable eye contact. Bird and I said "Yes. He's perfect." as soon as he was out of the room. Molly did not feel the same way. After some *persuading* she reluctantly jotted the model's name down, looked at us and said, "That's fine. I will not pretend I agreed to this. So, when the client doesn't like him, I just want you two to know: your ass is grass."

### Nancy and Steve Cameron

Whenever we saw Molly, she would always greet us with a big smile and a warm hug. And she never failed to make us laugh. So many wonderful stories and memories. Whenever Steve ran next door (shore house) to check or fix something, and Molly was there, she would always greet him with a laugh and a big smile, saying (with a wee bit of drama), 'Thank God you're here.' If Steve can’t fix it, then we’re all screwed.’  She loved his steamed clams (with melted butter and cocktail sauce) so much that he named them after her, Molly clams. Once, we were all sitting around, and the subject of stressful driving situations came up. Someone mentioned driving in heavy traffic and trying to merge with cars flying by. Molly just laughed and said, ‘I just throw my blinker on and hope for the best.’ She always had a talent for making an ordinary story so funny. When Molly saw me outside, she would always yell over, ‘Hi, Aunt Nancy!’ in her sing-song voice, and I would reply right back, ‘Hi, Miss Molly!’ Always interested in what our plans were for the day. I would often see her walking around the deck, looking out over the bay, her hands on the back of her hips, moving slowly and purposefully. She didn’t walk, actually. She glided. With such poise and grace. Almost like she was floating. This is my favorite and fondest memory of her. The last time I saw her, she was doing just that, and she looked beautiful in a flowing white dress. Like an angel. And that is how I see her whenever I think of her. Our forever angel.

### Mary Samori Moran

Molly was a bright light, always caring and curious. Whenever we spoke or texted, she always wanted to know what was going on with me and our family, especially, our Chris. I never knew she held such prestigious positions at work, as she never shined a light on herself, only others.

Molly was the baby cousin at our infamous girl cousin gatherings. Although so much younger than all, she always fit right in, adding humor and classic stories. We were so proud of ourselves when we finally pulled off organizing a cousins’ gathering in November 2023. We all had an amazing time sharing good food, stories, laughs and memories. It was the last time I saw our precious, Molly, and I will treasure the memory of that gathering forever.

Her mischievous grin, bright eyes, curious nature and classic beauty combined with her love for family and friends epitomized our Molly. I think of her every day and she will remain in my mind and heart forever.

### Temma Shoaf

Molly is one of my favorite people on the planet. We share a similar kind of warped sense of humor that delights in the absurd and outlandish. The number of times I look to the sky and call out to Molly to appreciate an aside, a joke, a joke on me, a joke on her, the absurd, the morbid, the mundane--it's a crazy number of times. I have never considered myself a lucky person, but this past year I have been blessed in numerous ways. I truly believe she is my guardian angel, and has been looking out for me. Molly and I would see plays and shows together. She would ping me when she felt she needed some culture and we would get a plan together. Truly you haven't lived until the lights come up for intermission on a show where Molly is confused and has no idea what's going on. It's the best ever. I received a notification on my phone on March 6, my birthday calendar alerting me to Molly's birthday. I have two friends who have birthdays on March 6, but Molly's was the alert I received. The alert I didn't need because I had been counting down the days, and thinking of the approaching day, one year later, when we lost such a beautiful and perfect person. I cherish all of my memories of Molly. We had some crazy fun times.

### Megan Prasch

I’ll never forget meeting Molly for the first time on a family beach trip. Mike was bringing his girlfriend!!! She was the kindest soul. We poured a drink and hung in the ocean and got to know each other. I felt like I had known her for years! She fit right in with the whole rowdy family. I always loved her connection with my dad- he loved her dearly!

I look back on all my time with Molly so fondly-always greeting with a welcoming hug and a genuine excitement to catch up. She will be missed forever.

### Wendy Withers

Hi Wends. I can hear my pal greeting me in that voice. As if she was next to me right now.

Molly and I would share lunch breaks on the steps of our office building. We jabbered about work, play, the central park jogger case, her besties, grandpa joe, her parents and brothers. She had the best stories.

The last time I saw Molly, three days before she left us, we met in a tiny coffee shop. We hadn’t seen each other in person in ages. She witnessed me having a hot flash and insisted that I remove a layer. It was an hysterical moment. I walked her to work where she greeted everyone entering and leaving the office building, as if she was the mayor. She knew everyone and everyone knew her. Molly was beloved. One of a kind. I love you forever Molls.

### Lynne Lewis

I was so thankful to have had our cousin’s dinner together. Molly loved bringing people together and I remember the special day she pulled together for us in DUMBO.

I use Molly’s approach to life as a north

### Dana Dobbins

I wanted to push this off until this time, when it marks one year. I wanted to make a point to myself that during this past year I have remembered everything that we did when we were kids, teens, young adults, and now. The memories will last, and our connection will never end. I know the way she smells, the way she laughed, her slender fingers, her beauty marks, the way she told stories, how I remembered more of her life than her, the way she would sleep, or how she would pretend to listen, or how hard she can pinch, how it sounded when she blew her nose or used her inhaler, the stories of all the people that she was friend's with- their stories too, how proud she was of me, how hard we would laugh. I don't think this makes sense at all, what I am typing. I am overwhelmed with nearly 40 years of memories that met a tragic and devastating end. Molly was everything that was right in the world and her unconditionally loving soul will always be with me. Michael you were the only person that truly made her love herself enough to be a parent. A piece of me, and a piece of you will always be dead. Whatever you create will be treasured by me.

Molly told me my dad was gay in 4th grade. She and I got into a lipstick fight once, and cleaned up singing to "working hard for the money." Our brothers used to make us box on my parent's bed, she kicked my ass. We would trick or treat together. I remember a conversation recently between Molly and my dad, when my dad asked Molly "how do you feel being 10 now?" and she said "sad b/c I will never be only one digit age again." We were walking in the hallway after a spring concert in 4th grade. Molly's grandma white broke her arm when we visited LBI in the late 80s. Molly was both of my grandma's favorites. They just loved Molly. She loved my mom's shrimp sauce. One time in her car I changed all her radio stations to hot 97 and she got so mad. the first time I went to NYC myself she was waiting under "the big sign" at Penn Station. I can't do anymore now. I will pick up in our 20s when I can breathe again.

### Daniela Dowd

I have yet to meet a better storyteller. Molly could hold you on the edge of your seat while telling you about a trip to the grocery store or other mundane task. She brought life to every moment.

### Kate Riesenberg

Molly, How have I not spoken to you in a year. A whole year. A year ago today I said to Taylor “I don’t know how to live life without her.” I feel you with me everyday. I hope beyond hope that you somehow see how I’m doing, how much I love Finn. No one would have been happier. You are with us and a part of our lives forever.

### Kate Boyle

One of the last conversations we had was about a gift basket for Theo's school auction. She was gathering up some Warby Parker items to include and emphasized how she wanted it to be the best basket, the one that everyone wanted to win. Her love for her kids could not have been more apparent and she beamed with pride and joy whenever she spoke of them. An incredible mother, coworker, friend, and so much more tragically gone too soon. I’ll always be grateful for Molly’s warmth and will cherish our water cooler talks forever.

### Vanessa Rocks

Our self choreographed dances in the basement of 40 Walker Road were epic!

### Jenna Perry

For four years, I had the absolute privilege of seeing Molly every month in my chair. As her hair colorist, I got to witness her vibrant spirit firsthand. Her warmth, her humor, and the way she lit up the salon. She wasn’t just my client; she was a bright energy, and a friend. I feel so lucky to have shared those moments with her, and I miss her dearly. Sending love to the Dowd family and all who knew her.

Molly used to run out of the salon to pay the parking meter with her haircolor on her head and the salon gown on! She was truly the best.

### Kelly Arthur

Molly's conversational aptitude was unmatched. Whether talking about family, fashion, or dental floss, she had an enchanting way of weaving honesty, wit, and frivolity into every topic. Always said with a twinkle in her eye, a sultry voice, and a giggle at the end, her perspective made this world a more delightful place. Love you forever, Dolly.

### Eamon Wall

At work, Molly led by quiet example. Her humble warmth and authenticity were immediately clear to anyone who met her. She made everyone feel at ease, while also being the smartest person in the room. That combination of grounded humility, kindness, and wisdom still inspires me.

Though we never worked in the same office, we were on the same team for years. I was based in LA, and anytime I flew in for a shoot—even after nearly two years—Molly greeted me like an old friend and made me feel at home.

It was those little moments on set that stuck with me. We used to chat about her daughter, Georgie, and how we shared the same birthday. She’d light up when talking about her, and those little sincere, kind moments conversations still mean a lot.

So many of us at Warby looked up to Molly. Just the way she carried herself made us want to be better people. I remember thinking—and still think—I hope I can be as good of a parent as Molly one day.

She was a friend to everyone. She seemed to feed off the light and laughter from people.

### Casey Jennings

Molly was such a light in my life. We used to have ladies dinners together - we celebrated our birthdays and big moments together. It was a group of 7 of us. The last time we saw each other was about a month and a half before the accident. We were celebrating a birthday in the group. Right before the dinner the birthday girl got sick and couldn’t make it. So the rest of us went to dinner anyway, it was just 4 of us. We laughed and told stories for 5 hours. Molly wore a bright red sweater, her hair was down. I left that dinner feeling so grateful that I had such good female friends. We all lifted each other up. Molly was warm, caring, thoughtful but also so funny and self deprecating. The last text exchange we had was planning Molly’s and another friend’s birthday dinner. And we never got to do it. I miss Molly so much and think about her often. I know she’s watching down on all of us especially her sweet Michael, Theo and Georgie. Molly, you will forever be in our hearts. So appreciative of the time we had together.
